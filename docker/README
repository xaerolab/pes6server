Fiveserver in Docker
====================


Build
~~~~~

To build the docker image, run:

docker build -f Dockerfile -t fiveserver ..


Prep
~~~~

Fiveserver and Sixserver run in containers under non-privileged user,
called "five", with pre-defined uid=3066 and gid=3066. Although it is
not strictly necessary, to make things sane, you should create a group
and a user with such ids:

groupadd -g 3066 five && useradd -u 3066 -g five five 

In most cases you would want to have your configuration
and the logs outside of the docker containers. Choose a directory where
you want to have conf and logs and copy the default configuration
there, then set correct ownership of the files.
For example, you want the root dir to be "/opt/five". Then:

mkdir /opt/five
cp -r ../etc ../log /opt/five/
chown -R five:five /opt/five/log
chown -R five:five /opt/five/etc/data

Modify configuration as desired. At the minimum, you should change
the admin usernames/passwords in etc/conf/admin.yaml and etc/conf/admin6.yaml


Run
~~~

To create and start new containers:

docker run -d --net=host --name=fiveserver --restart=always -v /opt/five/etc:/opt/fiveserver/etc -v /opt/five/log:/opt/fiveserver/log -e SVC=fiveserver fiveserver
docker run -d --net=host --name=sixserver --restart=always -v /opt/five/etc:/opt/fiveserver/etc -v /opt/five/log:/opt/fiveserver/log -e SVC=sixserver fiveserver
